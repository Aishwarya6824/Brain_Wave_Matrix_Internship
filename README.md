 Task 01 – Interactive Navigation Menu

This project is part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix**. It focuses on creating an **interactive navigation menu** designed for a **study/tutorial website**. The navigation bar is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and includes smooth style transitions based on **scrolling** and **hover effects**. It is fixed in position and remains visible across all pages for enhanced usability.

 🔧 Features

- Fixed top navigation bar for consistent access
- Dynamic style changes on scroll (e.g., background color, shadow, etc.)
- Hover effects to highlight menu items
- Responsive design suitable for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
- Lightweight and clean code structure
